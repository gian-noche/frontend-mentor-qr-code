## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The main take-away for me on this challenge is that on simple designs like this,
the normal flow of elements is enough to achieve the required layout with just
a few adjustments with the spacing and alignment.

### Continued development

Using the simplest way to center items is something I need to improve on as this was
the part that took me the longest to figure out for the container.
